            | Welcome to Jack and Grimm Travel, my captivating travel blog chronicling my unforgettable adventure of following my fat 
            | cat Grimm around Europe (mostly the EU I'm not arsed with visas). As a lazy prick with nothing better on I decided 
            | to go for a bit of a nose around Europe for a bit, see what all the fuss is about. Given I'd rather Grimm was 
            | alive and well when I get back I have opted to bring the lumpy grumpy with me.

            | In this blog, we share our escapades as we traverse the diverse landscapes and rich cultures of Europe in our 
            | probably piece of crap van (I don't have the van yet). Together, I'll probably carry him as I look at cool shit
            | and he'll give out stink about literally everything and then go for a snooze in the sun. I've great intentions of
            | leashing him and going on hikes and stuff but he's a lazy pig so I don't see it happening.
            | Our journey knows no boundaries except the EU (sorry Turkiye, you look beautiful though).
            br
            p
            | As I'm fond of the little pud I've put some effort into thinking about his comfort and safety throughout our 
            | travels by teaching him boxing, the only fighting style capable of besting a bear. He'll have his own little 
            | suite in the van and a dedicated place to soak up rays where I can rub his fat cat belly and enjoy how warm he is.
            br
            p
            | Myself, I'll be knocking about at whatever sounds interesting (recommend me stuff!). I'll be detailing the van
            | conversion, talking about whatever music I'm listening to or books I'm reading and attempting to work odd jobs 
            | to pay for diesel and food in between pretending France is nice and it's only Parisians who give them a bad name.

            | the blog make sure to check out the instagram (@jackandgrimmtravel) but it's probably going to be similar to here.

              | An Irishman soon to be lost abroad, I originally hail from the futuristic lands of Leitrim. Growing up on a diet 
              | of spuds and guinness, I somehow overcame crippling malnourishment to become a fine lad of normal proportions 
              | (all Irish people have big heads that's not on me).

              | I spent my youth playing GAA, failing to chase women and generally being a massive nerd building PCs and sometimes
              | fixing phones and stuff like that, I've always had great interest in maths, science and computers which served me 
              | well in getting into university and learning to do stuff like make savage websites like this one (I do commissions).
              | Unfortunately once I got to Galway I discovered pints, drugs (sorry Mam) and goth girls and promply did fuck all college 
              | work and nearly dropped out but I powered through and am now the proud owner of a sheet of paper which says I can do 
              | Engineering.

              | and potentially fucking my life up even more! Follow the journey to see how I get on.

              | graduation gift and here we are. Now he uses me as a bench and gets fucking pissed if I'm doing something where he 
              | can't sit on me. He also gets very upset when left along and loves dreamies.
